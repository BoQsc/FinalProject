Make sure you have fast startup disabled in Windows, otherwise you won't be able to write to NTFS partitions. If you previously disabled fast startup, a subsequent Windows update may have re-enabled it. Irritating, but true. In case you need it, here's how to disable fast startup:

Also. Don't do a restart from Windows. Even if you have fast startup disabled, I believe Windows will do a hybrid shutdown when you select restart/reboot or whatever it is called in Windows. You need to shutdown from Windows and then do a cold boot into Ubuntu.

By the way, by fast startup, I'm referring to the Windows "feature", not fast boot in BIOS.
